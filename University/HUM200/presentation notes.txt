Action Francaise [aksjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛz]
================

 - Fascist, or not?
 - 1899–2017
    - yes, really, 2017 (screenshot of Pepe article)

 - context:
    - French Third Republic
       - from the collapse of the Bonapartist Second Empire in 1870 ...
          - Franco-Prussian War
             - (justified) fear over the upcoming ‘Unification of Germany’ (1871-1918)
             - defeat at the Battle of Sedan (like the car), Napoleon III was captured, and the
               Third Republic was formed (by Léon Gambetta, who escaped in a hot-air balloon)

       - was originally provisional, but a lack of direction in reinstalling the Monarchy, and a
         rise in Republican values, led it to become permanent around the 1880s
          - apparently, a disagreement over the "tricolor flag" primarily led to the lack of
            establishing a monarch
       - France was *already* sharply divided, despite a relatively-stable republic ("the form of
         government that divides France least", Thiers); Reformist France vs. the Catholics/army
       - during the occupation by Prussia, the right-wing provisional government taxed heavily,
         paid reparations to the Prussians, inciting the first socialist revolts (the Paris Commune,
         quickly put down by the provisional government)

       - ... until the Nazi-installed Vichy govenrment in 1940 (thru the Allied liberation in 1944)

 - Alfred Dreyfus
    - ‘the Dreyfus affair’
       - 1894–1906
       - exonerated by new info with preference to Ferdinand Esterházy,
       - but was covered up by military officials
       - died in 1935
    - largely divided France: army vs. republicans, Catholics vs. anti-clericals
