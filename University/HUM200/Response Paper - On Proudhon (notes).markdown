 - thesis
    - weird to write a history paper on a period of history, and a country, that I could not know
      *less* about. perhaps a unique perpsective?


 - summarize
    - schapiro:
       - P basically garnered attention in the first place due to:
         1. a receptive climate,
         2. a desperate, and ignored, middle-class
       - P says the property-thing is misunderstood
       - P was not a revolutionary in the traditional, combative sense
       - P was primarily elitist and misanthropic
       - P was, rather than anarchist, actually in support of dictatorship
       - P's arguments were illogical and fuzzy
    - chiaromonte:
       - S is primarily slander?
       - S mis-interpreted P in his claims of P being mis-interpreted
          - P did not support dictatorship, he thought dictatorship irrelevant to social change
          - P did not support war, he *assumed* support-of-war to make a point
          - P is not, after all, anti-Negro/Semite/etc
       - C uses a lot of hyperbole
       - P is to be lauded for his unconventional and wide-ranging thought, and for being unclear
         without deep analysis
       - because people don't like him, P must be valuable

 - analysis of schapiro / chiaromonte's motivations
    - schapiro:
       - seems entirely academic
       - wishes to correct an academic point about a previous academic position (“proudhon was an
         anarchist”) that he saw to be incorrect (“proudhon espoused some anarchist ideas, but
         supported dictatorship”)
       - wishes to add context to the history, demonstrate links he sees that he feels were under-
         noticed
    - chiaromonte:
       - in addition to the strikingly similar motivation of S himself (“repair an academic
         mistake”),
       - ... C seems ...

 - my feelings on the arguments
    - have trouble forming an opinion w/o consulting original sources
    - vaguely feel that S made his argument better and/or was more believable than the rebuttal
    - if nothing else, S directly cites *more* sources — although I cannot assert the quality of
      them
    - concerned that I may just feel an affinity for the one I read first, wish I'd read them in the
      reverse order
    - both are *aided* in their argument by the difficulty of clearly defining Fascism, but S moreso
    - C does a good job of calling out flaws in S's logic, but a poor job of making her argument
      with those flaws
       - most compelling are the discussions of the Socratic method and the reference to the 2,000-
         page treatise on justice; also arguments against anti-Negro'ism
       - least so, his strange ad-hominems against P??? and claims that “anybody familiar with could
         see”, etc

 - conclusion
