 - Occurence of insomnia
    - Figures for general population
    - Increased risk for women
    - (Black populations?)
    - Few patients actually seek aid, resorting to over-the-counter solutions, alcohol, etc
    - Pharmacological treatments:
       - benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists
    - Non-pharmacological treatments (acupuncture?)
 - Overview CBT:
    - Reduce negative behaviour patterns (categorized as either a deficit in desired behaviour, or
      an excess of undesired behaviour) by attacking ‘cognitive distortions’: so-called errors in
      thinking that are thought to cause or reinforce these negative behaviour patterns (ex.
      overgeneralizing, or focusing on the negatives of a situation.)
       - “... behavioral therapy approaches during the first half of treatment and cognitive therapy
         during the latter portion.”
    - Has been widely shown to be effective to many disorders besides insomnia, including ...
 - Behavioural factors in insomnia
    - In both primary and comorbid
    - Things like sleep hygiene, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep;
       - Official sleep scales like the DBAS, SHPS
 - Effectiveness of CBT on insomnia
    - Generally, a large number of studies show effective results
    - Specific CBT techniques, however, aren't shown to work well
    - Methods of application, Cost-effectiveness
       - CCBT (computerized) over the Internet; application by primary-care nursing personnel

### CBT

1. *Treatment of adult insomnia with cognitive-behavioral therapy* (Pigeon)

   A review of “the typical assessment and CBT for adult insomnia, which have substantial empirical
   support for its efficacy.”

 - *Referral practices for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A survey study* (Conroy,
       Ebben)

   Physicians often, despite the literature, think CBT isn't worth referring; the paper suggests
   additional physician education.

 - *Reducing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep does not significantly improve insomnia in cognitive
   behavioral therapy* (Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, Inoue)

   Correcting participants' mistaken assumptions about sleeping didn't directly help improve their
   insomnia?

 - *Manual‐guided cognitive–behavioural therapy for insomnia delivered by ordinary primary care
   personnel in general medical practice: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial* (Bothelius,
   Kyhle, Espie, Broman)

   It may be more cost-effective to directly administer CBT through primary-care personnel, such as
   nurses, than through doctors?

 - *Internet-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia* (Voinescu, Szentagotai, David)

   CBT for insomnia can beneficially (and cost-effectively) be applied over the Internet

 - *Comparisons of short-term efficacy between individual and group cognitive behavioral therapy for
   primary insomnia* (Yamadera, Sato, Harada, Iwashita, Aoki, Ryo, Obuchi, Ozone, Itoh, Nakayama)

   Individually-administered CBT showed markedly superior effectualness compared to
   group-administered CBT.

 - *Baseline depression levels do not affect efficacy of cognitive‐behavioral self‐help treatment
   for insomnia* (Lancee, van den Bout, van Straten, Spoormaker)

   Shows that CBT treatment for insomnia is equally effective *whether or not* the patient is
   depressive.

 - *Cognitive and behavioral factors in insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety* (Tsai, Chen,
   Cheng, Chang, Chen, Yang)

   A comparison of primary-insomnia with various comorbid insomnias

 - *The Role of Sleep-Related Beliefs to Improvement in Early Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
   Insomnia* (Jansson-Fröjmark, Linton)

   Reduction of ‘sleep-related beliefs’ shows improvement in daytime symptoms, but not sleep symtoms

### Requested on ILL
 - *An international survey of sleeping problems in the general population.* (Léger, Poursain,
   Neubauer, Uchiyama)

   Contains information on sleep-issue prevalence: “In a rep- resentative sample, Leger et al. [2]
   found a prevalence of sleeping problems (during the past 12 months) of 56 % in the USA, 31 % in
   Western Europe, and 23 % in Japan.”

Notes
=====
### Comparative Meta-Analysis of Pharmacotherapy and Behavior Therapy for Persistent Insomnia (Smith, Perlis, Park, Smith, Pennington, Giles, Buysse)

 - “Ten percent to 15% of adults report persistent sleep problems”
 - “The cost of insomnia in terms of lost productivity and accidents has been estimated to be $77–$92
   billion annually”
 - “More than 50% of primary care patients experience insomnia, but only about one-third mention
   this problem to their physicians, and only 5% seek treatment.”

Shows that behaviour therapy and pharmacotherapy produce similar short-term results in primary
insomnia.

### Treatment of adult insomnia with cognitive-behavioral therapy (Pigeon)

Measurement mechanisms for sleep:
>  “Finally, among the several validated, self-report instruments for the assessment of sleep
>  disturbance, the most widely used when assessing insomnia are the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
>  (Buysee, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989), which provides a global assessment of sleep,
>  and the more disease-specific Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 2001)”

‘Underpinnings’ of CBT-I:
>  “the application of both operant and classical conditioning paradigms in the from of stimulus
>  control instructions (Bootzin & Nicassio, 1978); (b) the focus on sleep-interfering behaviors in
>  the form of sleep hygiene (Hauri, 1982); (c) the recognition of and focus on reducing the
>  hyperarousal features of insomnia (Lichstein, 1988); (d) the improvement of circadian and sleep
>  homeostasis regulation of sleep with sleep scheduling and limited, partial sleep deprivation
>  (Spielman, Caruso, & Glovinsky, 1987); and (e) the adaptation of cognitive therapy to insomnia”

“The standard delivery of CBT-I is structured to allow for weekly sessions to occur over 6–8 weeks.”

Types of involved therapy:
 - “Stimulus control therapy limits the amount of time patients spend awake in bed or in the bedroom
   and also begins to develop a more consistent sleep schedule.”
 - “Sleep restriction therapy limits the amount of time that patients spend in bed to an amount that
   matches their ability to fill this with mostly sleep.”
 - “Sleep hygiene is a catch-all term for a set of instructions geared toward helping the patient
   maintain good sleep habits, such as keeping an environment and routine conducive to sleep,
   maintaining a regular bed and wake time, and avoiding tobacco, alcohol, large meals, and vigorous
   exercise for several hours prior to bed.”
 - “Cognitive therapy may take one of several forms that differ slightly with respect to emphasis,
   although all focus on the negative thoughts and/or maladaptive beliefs about sleep, insomnia, and
   its consequences. ... helping patients to challenge the veracity and usefulness of these
   unhelpful thoughts and beliefs and then to change or modify them is the goal.”

“the standard insomnia patient encountered in clinical practice is seldom free of
comorbidities.”
