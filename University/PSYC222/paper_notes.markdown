 - Occurence of insomnia
    - Problem of insomnia: prevalence, cost, etc.
    - Figures for general population
    - Increased risk for women
    - (Black populations?)
    - Often co-morbid with other diseases
    - Few patients actually seek aid, resorting to over-the-counter solutions, alcohol, etc
    - Pharmacological treatments:
       - benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists
    - Non-pharmacological treatments (acupuncture?)
 - Overview CBT:
    - Reduce negative behaviour patterns (categorized as either a deficit in desired behaviour, or
      an excess of undesired behaviour) by attacking ‘cognitive distortions’: so-called errors in
      thinking that are thought to cause or reinforce these negative behaviour patterns (ex.
      overgeneralizing, or focusing on the negatives of a situation.)
       - “... behavioral therapy approaches during the first half of treatment and cognitive therapy
         during the latter portion.”
    - Has been widely shown to be effective to many disorders besides insomnia, including ...
 - Behavioural factors in insomnia
    - In both primary and comorbid
    - Things like sleep hygiene, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep;
       - Official sleep scales like the DBAS, SHPS, PSQI, ISI
 - Effectiveness of CBT on insomnia
    - Generally, a large number of studies show effective results
    - Specific CBT techniques, however, aren't shown to work well
    - Methods of application, Cost-effectiveness
       - CCBT (computerized) over the Internet; application by primary-care nursing personnel

### CBT

 * *Treatment of adult insomnia with cognitive-behavioral therapy* (Pigeon)

   A review of “the typical assessment and CBT for adult insomnia, which have substantial empirical
   support for its efficacy.”

 - *Referral practices for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A survey study* (Conroy,
       Ebben)

   Physicians often, despite the literature, think CBT isn't worth referring; the paper suggests
   additional physician education.

 - *Reducing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep does not significantly improve insomnia in cognitive
   behavioral therapy* (Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, Inoue)

   Correcting participants' mistaken assumptions about sleeping didn't directly help improve their
   insomnia?

 - *Manual‐guided cognitive–behavioural therapy for insomnia delivered by ordinary primary care
   personnel in general medical practice: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial* (Bothelius,
   Kyhle, Espie, Broman)

   It may be more cost-effective to directly administer CBT through primary-care personnel, such as
   nurses, than through doctors?

 - *Internet-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia* (Voinescu, Szentagotai, David)

   CBT for insomnia can beneficially (and cost-effectively) be applied over the Internet

 - *Comparisons of short-term efficacy between individual and group cognitive behavioral therapy for
   primary insomnia* (Yamadera, Sato, Harada, Iwashita, Aoki, Ryo, Obuchi, Ozone, Itoh, Nakayama)

   Individually-administered CBT showed markedly superior effectualness compared to
   group-administered CBT.

 - *Baseline depression levels do not affect efficacy of cognitive‐behavioral self‐help treatment
   for insomnia* (Lancee, van den Bout, van Straten, Spoormaker)

   Shows that CBT treatment for insomnia is equally effective *whether or not* the patient is
   depressive.

 - *Cognitive and behavioral factors in insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety* (Tsai, Chen,
   Cheng, Chang, Chen, Yang)

   A comparison of primary-insomnia with various comorbid insomnias

 - *The Role of Sleep-Related Beliefs to Improvement in Early Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
   Insomnia* (Jansson-Fröjmark, Linton)

   Reduction of ‘sleep-related beliefs’ shows improvement in daytime symptoms, but not sleep symtoms

### Requested on ILL
 - *An international survey of sleeping problems in the general population.* (Léger, Poursain,
   Neubauer, Uchiyama)

   Contains information on sleep-issue prevalence: “In a representative sample, Leger et al. [2]
   found a prevalence of sleeping problems (during the past 12 months) of 56% in the USA, 31% in
   Western Europe, and 23% in Japan.”

Notes
=====
### Comparative Meta-Analysis of Pharmacotherapy and Behavior Therapy for Persistent Insomnia (Smith, Perlis, Park, Smith, Pennington, Giles, Buysse)

 - “Ten percent to 15% of adults report persistent sleep problems”
 - “The cost of insomnia in terms of lost productivity and accidents has been estimated to be $77–$92
   billion annually”
 - “More than 50% of primary care patients experience insomnia, but only about one-third mention
   this problem to their physicians, and only 5% seek treatment.”

Shows that behaviour therapy and pharmacotherapy produce similar short-term results in primary
insomnia.

### Treatment of adult insomnia with cognitive-behavioral therapy (Pigeon)

Measurement mechanisms for sleep:
>  “Finally, among the several validated, self-report instruments for the assessment of sleep
>  disturbance, the most widely used when assessing insomnia are the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
>  (Buysee, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989), which provides a global assessment of sleep,
>  and the more disease-specific Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 2001)”

‘Underpinnings’ of CBT-I:
>  “the application of both operant and classical conditioning paradigms in the from of stimulus
>  control instructions (Bootzin & Nicassio, 1978); (b) the focus on sleep-interfering behaviors in
>  the form of sleep hygiene (Hauri, 1982); (c) the recognition of and focus on reducing the
>  hyperarousal features of insomnia (Lichstein, 1988); (d) the improvement of circadian and sleep
>  homeostasis regulation of sleep with sleep scheduling and limited, partial sleep deprivation
>  (Spielman, Caruso, & Glovinsky, 1987); and (e) the adaptation of cognitive therapy to insomnia”

“The standard delivery of CBT-I is structured to allow for weekly sessions to occur over 6–8 weeks.”

Types of involved therapy:
 - “Stimulus control therapy limits the amount of time patients spend awake in bed or in the bedroom
   and also begins to develop a more consistent sleep schedule.”
 - “Sleep restriction therapy limits the amount of time that patients spend in bed to an amount that
   matches their ability to fill this with mostly sleep.”
 - “Sleep hygiene is a catch-all term for a set of instructions geared toward helping the patient
   maintain good sleep habits, such as keeping an environment and routine conducive to sleep,
   maintaining a regular bed and wake time, and avoiding tobacco, alcohol, large meals, and vigorous
   exercise for several hours prior to bed.”
 - “Cognitive therapy may take one of several forms that differ slightly with respect to emphasis,
   although all focus on the negative thoughts and/or maladaptive beliefs about sleep, insomnia, and
   its consequences. ... helping patients to challenge the veracity and usefulness of these
   unhelpful thoughts and beliefs and then to change or modify them is the goal.”

“the standard insomnia patient encountered in clinical practice is seldom free of
comorbidities.”

Closes with a case-study on a 40-year-old father, Jerry.

### Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders and insomnia: a commentary on future directions (Aho, Pickett, Hamill)

 - “patients prefer CBT-I relative to drug treatment”

>  “CBT has overwhelming success for the treatment of anxiety disorders and is recommended as the
>  preliminary and foundational treatment for insomnia.”

CBT > pharmacological for anxiety:
>  “Although research also supports similar drug treatments for anxiety disorders and insomnia, such
>  as SSRIs, SNRIs, and benzodiazepines, many clinicians are not adequately trained to provide
>  evidence-based pharmacological treatment for anxiety. Further, the American Academy of Sleep
>  Medicine recommends that short-term drug intervention be used conservatively and be supplemented
>  by CBT. Pharmacological therapy is associated with high costs, daytime sleepiness, poor sleep
>  latency and continuity, amnesia, behavioural disinhibition, drug tolerance, cognitive impairment,
>  anxiety and insomnia rebound, and unknown or harmful long-term outcomes. By contrast, CBT
>  sustains improvements over a longer period of time relative to pharmacological intervention and
>  is preferred by patients.”

>  “Over 325 studies have established the efficacy of CBT, which decreases safety behaviours and
>  utilizes exposure, attention focus modification, and cognitive restructuring to gradually expose
>  patients to increasingly feared stimuli and allow habituation and extinction to occur. An effect
>  size of 0.64–0.70 has been observed for the efficacy of CBT for GAD, and CBT sustains treatment
>  effects for at least 2 years.”

Insomnia is a risk-factor for anxiety:
>  “Insomnia exacerbates anxiety disorder symptoms and is a significant risk factor in the
>  development of anxiety and other mental health disorders.”

CBT for insomnia, mostly reviewing Perlis:
>  “CBT-I includes sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and sleep hygiene
>  education. During sleep restriction therapy, insomnia patients attempt to lie in bed only for an
>  amount of time equal to their average sleep time. Although counterintuitive, sleep restriction
>  increases sleep exigency, decreases sleep latency, affords better sleep quality by inducing mild
>  distress, and may ameliorate sleep-related performance anxiety. Stimulus control therapy, a
>  principal treatment, significantly reduces insomnia through sleep environment modification, which
>  alleviates negative associations with the sleep environment. Modifications include lying in bed
>  only when sleepy, avoiding behaviours in the bedroom other than sleep or sexual activities, and
>  leaving the bedroom if awake after 15 minutes. Cognitive-based treatments generally include
>  patients’ education of the cognitive model of insomnia and addressing maladaptive thoughts about
>  the effects of insomnia on health in an attempt to ameliorate sleep-related anxiety. Finally,
>  sleep hygiene educates patients with empirically sound instructions to improve sleep quality,
>  quantity, and knowledge.”

### The evolution of insomnia in relation to comorbidity (Drake, Schwartz, Roth)

 - “One study has estimated that up to 70% of psychiatric patients also experience insomnia.”
 - “... sleep disturbance remains the most common refractory symptom of MDD in patients successfully
   treated either pharmacologically or using cognitive behavioral techniques.”
 - “In other disorders including cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic pain, and gastrointestinal
   problems, prevalence of insomnia was similar, ranging from 41.5% to 55.4%.”
 - “Comparisons consistently showed that most individuals within each disease category did not have
   insomnia, suggesting that those also reporting disturbed sleep patterns may have some underlying
   vulnerability.”
 - “Specific stressors associated with onset of insomnia were identified by 78.6% of insomniacs,
   with so-called “personal events” displaying the greatest disparity between insomniacs and
   controls.”

>  “Diagnostic criteria for insomnia include difficulty in initiating, maintaining, or having
>  non-restorative sleep patterns for at least 1 month; however, individuals are considered as
>  meeting these criteria only when clinically significant impairment or distress in important areas
>  of waking function is present. Typically, patients need to experience at least three nights of
>  sleep disturbance per week”

 - “... evidence continues to support a stress-related model of insomnia, including recent evidence
   for dysregulation of central corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and noradrenergic pathways.
   The literature on insomnia clearly supports the contention that stress is an important trigger of
   insomnia.”
    - “If this widely held assumption is true, the pathophysiology of insomnia may be related to
      hyperactivation of stress-response systems, which may in fact be the underlying cause of
      vulnerability in individuals predisposed to insomnia.”
 - “Current models of insomnia pathophysiology include abnormalities of the circadian system. Some
   support for this model comes from studies demonstrating reduced melatonin secretion10 and
   improvement of sleep disturbance in primary insomnia using medications that act directly on
   central melatonin receptors.”
 - “Thus, impaired homeostatic drive is at best a contributing factor to the evolution of insomnia.”


>  “... treatment regimens have benefited from heuristic models for decades, most of all the 3-P
>  model. This model, originally proposed by Speilman, posits three critical components involved in
>  the development of insomnia over time: a) vulnerability is thought to predispose normal
>  individuals to development of insomnia following b) exposure to some precipitating event, even
>  after this precipitating event is resolved, and c) perpetuating aspects continue to maintain
>  insomnia.”

>  “Among primary insomniacs, an increase in stress-related thoughts has been found to be related to
>  sleep complaints and reduced delta power on the electroencephalogram.”
