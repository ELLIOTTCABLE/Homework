   directions* (Hofmann, Asnaani, Vonk, Sawyer, Fang)

5. *Which nondrug alternatives can help with insomnia?* (Whitworth, Crownover, Nichols)

6. *Drug Treatment of Primary Insomnia - A Meta-Analysis of Polysomnographic Randomized Controlled
   Trials* (Winkler, Auer, Doering, Rief)

 - *Sleep in women: A review* (Bei, Coo, Baker, Trinder)

   Insomnia more likely in women, both physiological and psychological factors

### CBT

1. *Treatment of adult insomnia with cognitive-behavioral therapy* (Pigeon)

   A review of “the typical assessment and CBT for adult insomnia, which have substantial empirical
   support for its efficacy.”

 - *Referral practices for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A survey study* (Conroy,
       Ebben)

   Physicians often, despite the literature, think CBT isn't worth referring; the paper suggests
   additional physician education.

 - *Reducing dysfunctional beliefs about sleep does not significantly improve insomnia in cognitive
   behavioral therapy* (Okajima, Nakajima, Ochi, Inoue)

   Correcting participants' mistaken assumptions about sleeping didn't directly help improve their
   insomnia?

 - *Manual‐guided cognitive–behavioural therapy for insomnia delivered by ordinary primary care
   personnel in general medical practice: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial* (Bothelius,
   Kyhle, Espie, Broman)

   It may be more cost-effective to directly administer CBT through primary-care personnel, such as
   nurses, than through doctors?

 - *Internet-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia* (Voinescu, Szentagotai, David)

   CBT for insomnia can beneficially (and cost-effectively) be applied over the Internet

 - *Comparisons of short-term efficacy between individual and group cognitive behavioral therapy for
   primary insomnia* (Yamadera, Sato, Harada, Iwashita, Aoki, Ryo, Obuchi, Ozone, Itoh, Nakayama)

   Individually-administered CBT showed markedly superior effectualness compared to
   group-administered CBT.

 - *Baseline depression levels do not affect efficacy of cognitive‐behavioral self‐help treatment
   for insomnia* (Lancee, van den Bout, van Straten, Spoormaker)

   Shows that CBT treatment for insomnia is equally effective *whether or not* the patient is
   depressive.

 - *Cognitive and behavioral factors in insomnia comorbid with depression and anxiety* (Tsai, Chen,
   Cheng, Chang, Chen, Yang)

   A comparison of primary-insomnia with various comorbid insomnias

 - *The Role of Sleep-Related Beliefs to Improvement in Early Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
   Insomnia* (Jansson-Fröjmark, Linton)

   Reduction of ‘sleep-related beliefs’ shows improvement in daytime symptoms, but not sleep symtoms

### Requested on ILL
 - *An international survey of sleeping problems in the general population.* (Léger, Poursain,
   Neubauer, Uchiyama)

   Contains information on sleep-issue prevalence: “In a rep- resentative sample, Leger et al. [2]
   found a prevalence of sleeping problems (during the past 12 months) of 56 % in the USA, 31 % in
   Western Europe, and 23 % in Japan.”
