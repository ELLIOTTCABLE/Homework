Sleep disorders in the developed world have nearly become a pandemic. Modern life is rife with new
stressors that affect the health of our sleep, and in a holistic view, our entire lives. They cause
many billions of dollars of direct damages in developed nations (and even more indirectly!); they
are reported as affecting more than half of the population here in the United States; and they act
as a risk factor for many other serious disorders both mental and physiological, including
particularly anxiety and depression. Although there's a range of treatments for insomnia and related
sleep disorders, both pharmacological and non-medicinal in nature, one treatment in particular has
shown great promise: cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I. I'll cover herein some of
the recent research in the field, both in measuring the extent of these diseases, and in their
psychological treatments.

Insomnia is *far* more common than most lay-people believe: in a study across over 10,000
individuals, Léger, Poursain, Neubauer, and Uchiyama (2008) found that more than a quarter of the
population experienced ‘sleeping problems’ in Western Europe and Japan; and that number rose to a
striking 56% in our United States in specific. Despite more than 50% of primary-care patients
experiencing insomnia, less than 30% actually contact a physician about their problems, an almost
insignificant number actually *seek treatment*, as detailed by Smith et al. (2002). This disease has
also been shown to disproportionately affect otherwise-disadvantaged groups: not only does it often
manifest comorbidly with several other mental disorders, but insomnia manifests symptoms
significantly more often in both female (Bei, Coo, Baker, & Trinder, 2015; Léger et. al, 2008) and
African American (Ruiter, Decoster, Jacobs, & Lichstein, 2010) populations. In addition to those
suffering so-called ‘primary insomnia’ (that is, insomnia manifesting in the absence of another,
additional, related disorder), insomnia manifests with or acts as a risk factor for a number of
other debilitating conditions, such as alcohol and drug abuse, suicidal impulses, decreased immune
function, and reduced cardiovascular function; but most notably, insomnia often manifests
co-morbidly with the closely-related disorders of anxiety and depression (MDD).

As also detailed in Smith et al.'s summary (2002), sleep issues claim more than happiness: an
economic cost on the order of US$ 100 billion dollars is effected worldwide each year (in terms of
reduced productivity and accidents) by insomnia and sleep deprivation. Even disregarding estimated
economic impacts, the *direct* costs (that is, the cost of substances used to treat the condition,
along with related healthcare services) of insomnia in the United States were over US$ 14 billion in
1995 (according to Léger et. al, 2008). Such substances come in a very wide range, including the
traditional benzodiazepines and associated benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zopiclone, zolpidem and
zaleplon), as well as rarer prescriptions for sleep disorders like antidepressants (doxepin),
neuropeptides, progesterone receptor antagonists, hormones, melatonin receptor agonists,
antihistamines, antiepileptics, and narcotics (Winkler, Auer, Doering, & Rief, 2014); and beyond the
laundry-list of such pharmaceuticals, there's several non-pharmacological treatments for sleep
disorder, including everything from the cognitive-behavioural therapies I'll be discussing below to
acupuncture.

Despite the prevalence of such empirically-studied treatments available, however, a substantial
subset of the populations takes little advantage: more than one third of insomnia sufferers in
Western Europe were found have taken *no action at all* to combat their sleeping disorders; 10%
tried over-the-counter solutions, while 13% adopted non-pharmacological measures. Of those
respondents, though, as few as 3% (in Japan) consulted a physician about their symptoms (Smith et
al., 2002). This shows the disturbing tendency for the general public to treat insomnia (and indeed,
mental disorders in general) as less-serious and less-worthy of their efforts than physical
disability or sickness. Unfortunately, some of the at-home remedies undertaken by sufferers are
actually found to act as perpetuating influences (for instance, cigarettes or alcohol consumed
immediately before bedtime. (Drake, Schwartz, & Roth, 2008))

There is a great body of literature growing to support cognitive-behavioural therapy, or CBT-I,
being one of the strongest tools with which to address sleep-disorders. CBT-I consists of four
primary components (Pigeon, 2014):

a. *Stimulus control therapy* involves the limiting of time spent awake in the bedroom, engaged in
   activities other than sexual coitus and sleep (by suggesting, for instance, that the patient
   leave the bedroom if they find themselves awake for more then fifteen minutes); along with the
   promotion of a healthy bedroom environment. This aids to reduce stressful and negative
   associations with the sleep-environment.

b. *Sleep restriction therapy* limits, instead, the time that the patient spends *in* bed. The
   practitioner works with the patient to develop a self-reported sleep-diary, which allows them to
   measure the amount of time the patient is spending actually asleep, versus the time they are
   spending in bed. This is used to calculate the patient's ‘sleep efficiency’; and then they are
   instructed to go to bed (and get up!) at a particular time every day, a time that will result in
   them only having a very particular span of time to sleep in. This, counter-intuitively, is
   arranged to be a *short* period, thus increasing that ‘sleep efficiency’ as they sleep for a
   larger percentage of their time in bed. As this shows improvement, the practitioner works with
   the patient to slowly extend that sleeping period.

c. Besides stimulus control and sleep-restriction, there are also other generic elements of *sleep
   hygiene* in which the patient is educated: keeping a routine conducive to sleep, maintaining
   healthy bed- and wake-times, and avoiding things like tobacco, alcohol, or large meals
   immediately before bed. Basically, any negative activity contributing to sleep-disturbance
   becomes a therapeutic target.

d. Finally, *cognitive therapy* forms the final leg of a CBT-I program: the patient is coached by
   the practitioner in meeting their goals (in this case, a better sleep experience), by identifying
   dangerous or unhelpful thought-patterns and thinking, problematic behaviour, and maladaptive
   emotional responses that are standing between the patient and those goals. The patient is helped
   to challenge the veracity and usefulness of such problematic thoughts and beliefs, and then to
   change those beliefs and the resulting behaviour.

This approach originates from the cognitive model, that distorted beliefs on sleep (and the
resultant behaviour patterns) hyperarouse the central nervous system, and eventually result in
deregulated sleep cycles, which manifest as chronic insomnia. The process is designed to identify
and assault the sleep-interfering hyperarousal features of insomnia, and on the reinforcing of
circadian and sleep-homeostasis regulation (Pigeon, 2014). It is usually customized by the
practitioner along a pattern allowing for weekly CBT sessions, occurring over a pattern of six to
eight weeks (Pigeon, 2014), with the behavioural therapy portion taking place for approximately the
first half of that period, and the cognitive therapy following during the latter portion of the
treatment.

Throughout the literature, CBT-I has been repeatedly shown to be *especially* effective in treating
insomnia patients. For instance, amongst the various pharmacological treatments thereof, Winkler,
Auer, Doering, and Rief (2014) show that benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are
the most effective treatments by far in the general case; but CBT-I has been shown to reliably be at
least *as effective as*, and often more effective than, benzodiazepines (Smith et al., 2002). To
boot, CBT-I has no known negative side-effects; and is preferred by most patients, compared to
prospective pharmacological treatment (Aho, Pickett, & Hamill, 2014). Most tellingly, the American
Psychological Association (APA) has chosen CBT as the ‘treatment of choice’ for chronic insomnia,
both primary and comorbid, with 70-80% of treatments showing a positive response (Whitworth,
Crownover, & Nichols, 2007).

Importantly, however, insomnia cannot be examined in a vaccuum: it appears in concert with other,
related mental disorders very, very often. Drake, Schwartz, and Roth (2008) synthesize prior work
into some interesting numbers: almost three-quarters of psychiatric patients for other disorders
experience comorbid insomnia, and even with physiological issues (eg. cancer, diabetes,
hypertension, chronic pain, and gastrointestinal problems), comorbid insomnia appeared between
40-55% of the time. Strangely, however, in all cases, a significant number of patients did *not*
demonstrate any sleep disorder, suggesting that those doing so may be expressing some underlying
vulnerability. In specific, patients experiencing depression or anxiety (or a combination thereof)
most often experience comorbid insomnia: Drake et al. (2008) mentions that insomnia is the most
common refractory symptom of major-depressive disorder, while Tsai et al. (2013) place further
numbers on the prevalence of insomnia: between 67% to 84% for depressive disorders, and around
two-thirds for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Conversely, around 28% of general
insomnia subjects were presenting another mental disorder comorbidly.

This is important, because CBT-I is developed from precisely the related CBT treatments for those
same mental disorders. For anxiety, as an example, Aho, Pickett, and Hamill (2014) quote that “CBT
has overwhelming success for the treatment of anxiety disorders” and mention that it is recommended
strongly as the “preliminary and foundational” treatment in current practice: over three hundred
studies have shown CBT-A's effectiveness as a treatment for anxiety; with an effect-size of between
64% and 70%, and with positive effects sustained for over two years. In addition, just as shown
above for insomnia, CBT-A is shown to be superior to pharmacological treatment for GAD in a huge
array of ways. These matter, because a combined cognitive-behavioural treatment program can be
constructed for the vast number of patients experiencing comorbid insomnia with other psychiatric
disorders, one that simultaneously improves on their various disorders in a concerted fashion; this
leads to great effect, helping attack such tightly integrated disorders without allowing either to
continue reinforcing the other.

In the United States in particular (with an estimated 131 million people suffering from sleep
disorders!), but also all around the developed world, insomnia, anxiety, and depression are huge
(and growing) epidemics. Cognitive-behavioural therapies are one of the only tools equipped to
simultaneously assault such comorbid disorders effectively; and they are the *only* one that can do
so with no negative side-effects. It's preferred by patients, it's cost-effective, and these
qualities lend it the chance to lead to a massively increased quality-of-life in a *huge* segment of
the developed population.
