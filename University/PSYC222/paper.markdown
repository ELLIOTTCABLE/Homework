Sleep disorders in the developed world have nearly become a pandemic. Modern life is rife with new
stressors that affect the health of our sleep, and in a holistic view, our entire lives. They cause
many billions of dollars of direct damages in developed nations (indirectly, even more). They affect
more than half of the population here in the United States. They're even a risk factor for many
other serious disorders both mental and physiological; particularly, anxiety and depression.
Treatment is available for insomnia and related sleep disorders through a range of programmes, both
pharmacological and non-medicinal in nature. However, one treatment in particular has shown great
promise: ‘CBT-I,’ or cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia. Herein follows an examination of
the recent research on this topic; in measuring the extent of these diseases, and in psychological
treatments thereof.

Insomnia is more common than might be expected. Léger, Poursain, Neubauer, and Uchiyama (2008)
performed a study on this topic across over 10,000 individuals. They found that more than a quarter
thereof experienced ‘sleeping problems’ in Europe and Japan; rising to a striking 56% in the U.S.
Despite more than *half* of primary-care patients experiencing insomnia, less than 30% of those
actually contact a physician about their problems. Meanwhile, an almost insignificant number of
these patients actually seek treatment, as detailed by Smith et al. (2002). This disease has also
been shown to disproportionately affect otherwise-disadvantaged groups. Besides often manifesting
comorbidly with several other mental disorders, insomnia manifests symptoms significantly more often
in both female (Bei, Coo, Baker, & Trinder, 2015; Léger et al., 2008) and African American (Ruiter,
Decoster, Jacobs, & Lichstein, 2010) populations. Insomnia is often recognized as referring to
‘primary insomnia’ (that is, insomnia manifesting in the absence of an additional related disorder).
Unfortunately, insomnia also manifests with or acts as a risk factor for a number of other
debilitating conditions. These include alcohol and drug abuse, suicidal impulses, decreased immune
function, and reduced cardiovascular function. Most notably, however, insomnia often manifests
co-morbidly with the closely-related disorders of anxiety and depression (Major Depressive Disorder,
MDD).

As also detailed in Smith et al.'s summary (2002), these sleep issues claim much more than
individual well-being and happiness. An economic cost of US$ ~100 billion dollars (in terms of
reduced productivity and accidents) is effected worldwide, each year, by these sleep disorders. Even
disregarding general economic impact, the ‘direct costs’ (the cost of pharmacological treatments and
related healthcare services) are immense. In the United States alone, these totaled to over US$ 14
billion in 1995 (according to Léger et al., 2008). Such substances come in a very wide range of
treatment options. One may be prescribed the traditional benzodiazepines and associated
benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon). Additionally, there exist rarer
prescriptions for sleep disorders, such as antidepressants (doxepin), neuropeptides, progesterone
receptor antagonists, hormones, melatonin receptor agonists, antihistamines, antiepileptics, and
narcotics (Winkler, Auer, Doering, & Rief, 2014). Beyond this laundry-list of pharmaceuticals,
there's non-pharmacological treatments for these disorders, including everything from the
cognitive-behavioural therapies discussed, below to acupuncture.

Despite the quantity of such empirically-studied treatments available, however, a substantial subset
of these populations takes little-to-no advantage. More than one third of insomnia sufferers in
Western Europe were found have taken no action whatsoever to combat their sleeping disorders. 10% of
those that did only tried over-the-counter solutions, while 13% adopted alternative or
non-pharmacological measures besides CBT-I. Further, of those respondents, as few as 3% (in Japan)
consulted a physician about their symptoms (Smith et al., 2002). This shows the unfortunate tendency
for patients to treat insomnia (and mental disorders in general) as less serious than physical
disabilities or sicknesses. Even worse, some of the remedies undertaken by sufferers actually act as
perpetuating influences; for instance, cigarettes or alcohol consumed immediately before bedtime
(Drake, Schwartz, & Roth, 2008).

There is a growing body of literature supporting cognitive-behavioural therapy
as one of the strongest tools with which to address sleep-disorders. CBT-I involves four
primary components, as described by Pigeon (2014):

a. *Stimulus control therapy*. The limiting of time spent awake in the bedroom, engaged in
   activities other than sexual coitus and sleep. This also includes, in general, promoting a
   healthy bedroom environment. It is achieved, for instance, by instructing the patient to leave
   the bedroom temporarily, if they find themselves awake for more then fifteen minutes. This serves
   to reduce stressful and negative associations with the sleep-environment.

b. *Sleep restriction therapy*. This limits, instead, the time that the patient spends *in* bed. The
   practitioner works with the patient to develop a self-reported sleep-diary. Such allows them to
   measure the amount of time the patient is spending actually asleep, versus the time they are
   spending in bed. With this, the practitioner can calculate the patient's ‘sleep efficiency’. The
   patient is then instructed to go to bed / get up at a particular time every day. This period is
   chosen precisely to restrict the time available for sleep. This, counter-intuitively, is made
   marginally shorter. This process increases that ‘sleep efficiency,’ as their sleep accounts for a
   larger percentage of that time spent in bed. As that measurement shows improvement, the
   practitioner finally works with the patient to begin to re-extend their sleeping period.

c. Besides stimulus control and sleep-restriction, there are also other generic elements of *sleep
   hygiene* in which the patient is educated. Keeping a routine conducive to sleep, maintaining
   healthy bed- and wake-times, and avoiding things like tobacco, alcohol, or large meals
   immediately before bed. Effectively any negative activity contributing to sleep-disturbance
   becomes a therapeutic target.

d. Finally, a CBT-I program wraps up with *cognitive therapy*. The patient is coached by the
   practitioner in meeting their goals (in this case, a better sleep experience). This begins by
   identifying dangerous or unhelpful thought-patterns and thinking, problematic behaviour, and
   maladaptive emotional responses standing between the patient and those goals. The patient is
   helped to challenge the veracity and usefulness of such problematic thoughts and beliefs. Once
   the patient is aware of these, they can change those beliefs and their resultant behaviour.

The CBT-I approach originates from the ‘cognitive model’: that distorted beliefs regarding sleep (and
their resultant behaviour patterns) hyperarouse the central nervous system. Further, that these
eventually result in deregulated sleep cycles, which manifest as chronic insomnia. The process is
designed assault the sleep-interfering hyperarousal features of insomnia, and on the reinforcing of
circadian and sleep-homeostasis regulation (Pigeon, 2014). It is usually customized by the
practitioner into a pattern allowing for weekly CBT sessions, occurring over a period of six to
eight weeks (Pigeon, 2014). The behavioural therapy portion generally takes place during the
first half of that period, with the cognitive therapy following during the latter portion.

Throughout the literature, CBT is repeatedly shown to be especially effective in treating insomnia
patients. CBT-I has been shown to reliably be at least as effective as, and often more effective
than, benzodiazepines (Smith et al., 2002). For comparison, amongst the various pharmacological
treatments for the insomnias, Winkler, Auer, Doering, and Rief (2014) show that benzodiazepines are
the most effective. Further, CBT-I has no known negative side-effects; and is preferred by most
patients, compared to prospective pharmacological treatment (Aho, Pickett, & Hamill, 2014). Most
tellingly, the American Psychological Association (APA) has chosen CBT-I as the ‘treatment of
choice’ for chronic insomnia, both primary and comorbid. This is partially due to 70-80% of
treatments showing a positive response (Whitworth, Crownover, & Nichols, 2007).

Importantly, however, insomnia cannot be examined in a vacuum: it appears in concert with other,
related mental disorders very, very often. Drake, Schwartz, and Roth (2008) synthesize prior work
into some interesting numbers: almost three-quarters of psychiatric patients for other disorders
experience comorbid insomnia. Even with physiological issues (eg. cancer, diabetes, hypertension,
chronic pain, and gastrointestinal problems), comorbid insomnia appears between 40-55% of the time.
Strangely, however, in each pairing, a significant number of patients did *not* demonstrate sleep
disorder. This suggests that those doing so may be expressing some underlying vulnerability. In
one specific, patients experiencing depression and/or anxiety most often experience comorbid
insomnia.  Drake et al. (2008) mention that insomnia is the most common refractory symptom of
major-depressive disorder. Tsai et al. (2013) place further numbers on this prevalence: between 67%
and 84% for depression, and around two-thirds for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Conversely,
around 28% of general insomnia subjects presented another mental disorder comorbidly.

These links are crucial, because CBT-I is developed from the related CBT treatments originally
created for those precise mental disorders. Illustratively, Aho, Pickett, and Hamill (2014) wrote
that “CBT-A [cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety] has overwhelming success for the treatment
of anxiety disorders.” They also mention that it is recommended strongly as the “preliminary and
foundational” treatment in current practice. Over 300 studies have shown CBT-A's efficacy; with an
effect between 64% and 70%, and with positive effects sustained for over two years. In addition,
just as above with CBT-I, CBT-A is shown to be superior to pharmacological treatment for GAD in
numerous ways. These matter, because a combined CBT program can be constructed for the vast number
of patients experiencing insomnia comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Such a program can
simultaneously improve on their various disorders in a concerted fashion, to great effect. It can
mitigate such tightly integrated disorders without allowing either to defeat treatment by
reinforcing the other.

In the developed world, and the United States in particular (with ~131 million people suffering from
sleep disorders), insomnia, anxiety, and depression are epidemic. Cognitive-behavioural therapies
are one of the only tools equipped to simultaneously assault such comorbid disorders effectively.
More importantly, they are the *only* one that can do so without negative side-effects. CBT is
preferred by patients, it's extremely effective, and it's economical. These qualities lend us an
opportunity to realize massively increased quality-of-life for a *huge* segment of the developed
population.
