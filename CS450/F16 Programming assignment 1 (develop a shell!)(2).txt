 - This programming assignment is inspired by one given at MIT
   (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/homework/xv6-shell.html). The MIT assignment asks the
   students to implement the pipe “|” and IO indirection “>” operators. We ask you to implement the
   sequence and parallel command execution operators, “;” and “&” by modifying the skeleton code
   attached. Invoke your shell from the shell that comes with xv6.

 - You can find an example of using these two operators in page 4 of your text book.

 - Your test data will be graded.

 - Submit a document that will describe the code that you changed (where and why), as well as your
   test data. This document should not be more than 3 pages with at least a font size of 11.

 - The assignment is due September 14 to the Blackboard.
